Code Explanation (with comments)

[BITS 64]              ; This tells the assembler to generate 64-bit code (important for registers like RAX, RCX, etc.)

section .data          ; This is the data section where variables are stored

    index dq 32        ; Define a 64-bit (quad word) variable named "index" with value 32
    data  dq 24        ; Define another 64-bit variable "data" with value 24

section .text          ; Start of the code section (where the instructions go)

    global _start      ; This tells the linker that "_start" is the entry point of the program

_start:
    mov rax, [index]   ; Load the 64-bit value at memory address "index" into register RAX → RAX = 32
    mov rcx, [data]    ; Load the 64-bit value at memory address "data" into register RCX → RCX = 24

    push rax           ; Push the value in RAX (32) onto the stack
    push rcx           ; Push the value in RCX (24) onto the stack
 Final State After Execution:
RAX = 32

RCX = 24

Stack (top to bottom):

24 (from RCX)

32 (from RAX)

Summary:
This 64-bit NASM program:

Loads values from two memory variables (index and data) into registers.

Pushes them to the stack.

It doesn’t do any output, system calls, or loops — it's like a setup or utility snippet, probably used inside a larger assembly program or OS kernel.
